## 0. Introduction
<br/>

Layer 2 is a collective term for a specific set of Ethereum scaling solutions without severely sacrificing security and decentralization. While layer 2 executes heavy computations off-chain, it relies on layer 1 or Ethereum for security and decentralization.
<br/>
<br/>

Tokamak Network has been striving to establish an on-demand layer 2 protocol. More specifically, optimistic roll-up, adopted by platforms like Optimism or Boba Network, will be at the core of our service. Being ‘optimistic’ implies that we assume the validity of transactions unless there is a challenge. If transactions get ‘rolled-up,’ multiple transactions are collected into a batch and submitted to layer 1 at once. 

In the process, TON, the native token of Tokamak Network, must play a pivotal role in incentivizing users to act in an advantageous way for the protocol. In this context, diversifying the utilities of TON is crucial. 

Among possible utilities like governance or staking, we will exclusively discuss the way to maximize the utility of TON as a fee token in this paper.

### **1.1. Why TON to be a fee token?**
<br/>

If TON is a fee token, we can pay transaction fees in TON.
<br/>
<br/>

Why is it so important? No matter which applications or services people use on blockchains, making transactions is unavoidable. When you stake TON, it is a transaction. When you swap ETH for TON, it is a transaction as well. In other words, fee token utility guarantees the baseline demand for TON.

UX can be improved, too. Users do not necessarily have to hold many ETH just for transaction fees.
